          <h3>Carbon Emissions</h3>
          <p>Carbon emissions are an extremely serious issue for our current environmental situation. 
            Infact, it is predicted by many scientists that if we do not level the curve of rising carbon emissions soon, we may reach a point of no return of climate change.
            And while most of these emissions come from manufacturing corporations and factories, the everyday person is still able to do their part in limiting their emissions
            even slightly, to help prevent irreversible damage to our ozone.</p>
  
          <h3>Food Delivery Emissions</h3>
          <p><img src="images/infograph.png" alt="an infographic detailing the carbon emitted from a car"> According to a report done by The World Economic Forum, carbon dioxide
            emissions from delivery traffic (UberEats, DoorDash, GrubHub, etc) are expected to increase by 32% in the next decade, which would amount to about 6 million tons of CO2.
